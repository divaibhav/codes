    int mathMarks;
    int scienceMarks;
    float englishMarks;
    // initialize variables 

    cout << "Math marks = " 
    cout << "English marks = 
    cout << "Science marks = " 
    return 
    }
`code`

3. Analyse the below given code. And put single line comment of each mistake.

    For example: in the belwo code there are two mistakes
    `code`

        int main(){
            cout << "HelloWorld
        }

    `code`   

    Solution:

    `code`

            cout << "HelloWorld
        }

    `code`   

    ***Code the analyse***


`code`

    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;
    int main(){
    int mathMarks = 8.5;
    int scienceMarks = 78;
    int englishMarks = 65;
    cout << "Math marks = " << mathMarks << "\n";
    cout << "English marks = " << englishMarks << endl
    cout << "Science marks = "  scienceMarks << "\n";
    float percentage = 73.35;
    double average = 74;
    char section = C;
    bool isPassed = true;
    cout << "Percentage = " << percentage << \n";
    cout << "Average = " << average << "\n";
    cout << "Passed = " << isPassed << "\n"
    
    cout << test;
    return 0;
    }
